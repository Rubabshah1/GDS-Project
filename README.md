CS343 Graph Data Science Project: Node Classification and Link Prediction in Bibliographic Data

## Overview
This project aims to apply machine learning techniques to a bibliographic dataset using graph-based approaches. You will work in groups of up to four members. Each group must be divided into two sub-groups: one will be responsible for the node classification task, while the other will work on the link prediction task. The dataset is provided in CSV format, and students will need to clean, preprocess, and construct a graph to train models using Neo4j or Python-based machine learning frameworks integrated with Neo4j. The data cleaning, preprocessing, and graph construction should be common for both sub-groups.

## Dataset Description

The dataset is provided in CSV format and includes the following files:

- **`authors.csv`**  
  Contains:  
  `Author ID`, `Author Name`, `Author URL`

- **`journal.csv`**  
  Contains:  
  `Journal Name`, `Journal Publisher`

- **`paper.csv`**  
  Contains:  
  `Paper ID`, `Paper DOI`, `Paper Title`, `Paper Year`, `Paper URL`, `Paper Citation Count`, `Field of Study`, `Journal Volume`, `Journal Date`

- **`topic.csv`**  
  Contains:  
  `Topic ID`, `Topic Name`, `Topic URL`

- **`paper_journal.csv`**  
  Contains:  
  `Paper ID`, `Journal Name`, `Journal Publisher`

- **`paper_topic.csv`**  
  Contains:  
  `Paper ID`, `Topic ID`

- **`paper_reference.csv`**  
  Contains:
